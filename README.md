# SimpleWindowsSessionTimer
This is a simple tool to limit the amount of time that a user can be logged on to a session. I designed it for Public Access computers that belong to a client.

Language: C# / .NET (Windows Forms App)

## How to use

If you do not intend to modify the program before using it, please go to the [released version](https://github.com/domkirby/SimpleWindowsSessionTimer/releases/tag/v1) and follow those instructions.


*This is my first C# app so please pardon the sloppy code, learning as I go :*
